# unsigned-decoder
32 bit unsigned integer decoder: with decimal, binary, and hexadecimal

Developed with Java on Windows (ran on Linux and proportions are messed up).
Choose between converting a decimal, binary, or hexadecimal into each of the other three.
Only unsigned integers, and a maximum of 32 bits (0xFFFFFFFF).
